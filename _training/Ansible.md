Feature2H: "Mode of workshop : 20% theory 80% handson"
 
Feature2H: "<span>Mastering  Infrastructure as Code  using Ansible </span> is a holistic, comprehensive program <span>that covers practical aspects of IaC and how can it be implemented using Ansible.</span>"

Feature2: This program is a 6 to 12 hours corporate training workshop that spans across 23 key topics in Ansible. We use a technique called a use-case-based learning approach that engages learners in a hands-on exercise of specific scenarios that resemble real-world examples. We do reach us out for more details .
