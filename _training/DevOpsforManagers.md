Feature2H: "The <b>DevOps For Managers Workshop</b> is a holistic, comprehensive program that covers DevOps concepts in detail."

Feature2: This program is an 8 hours corporate training workshop that spans key topics in DevOps. The workshop is 60% theory and 40 % hands-on. Our hands-on modules are choreographed in such a way even if you are new to programming or have limited knowledge still you can follow. We use a technique called a use-case-based learning approach that engages learners in a hands-on exercise of specific scenarios that resemble real-world examples. Do reach out for more details.
