Feature2H: "Mode of workshop : 30% theory 70% handson"

Feature2: The Two day program is tailored for developers and testers who are not experts in unit testing and testable design. The program starts with understanding how to develop good unit tests, developers also  get to practice test first development and understand  the value of good testable design . The day 1 lays the foundation for developers to start experimenting with Test Driven Development. On day 2 we invest time in learning the art of TDD along with a deep dive to understand concepts and philosophy behind mocking.
