It took almost 2 months to learn popular 11 DevOps tools with every weekend spending 6 hours.
It was a great journey and I would like to Thank my trainer, mentor and coach Anju Dominic for the excellent DevOps hands on workshop. Each session is a new challenge (like in the video game levels ) with hands on tasks to complete in order to understand the concepts clearly.
The course was very well structured with separate doubt clearance sessions, class recordings and 1:1 sessions. Once again thank you very much Anju Dominic for your patience in teaching us and making us learn in the right pace.
