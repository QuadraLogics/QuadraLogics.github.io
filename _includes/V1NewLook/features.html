                    <p class="text" > This program spans for 12 weeks which includes 8 weeks of workshops and 4 weeks for a capstone project. We use a technique called the “Task-based learning”. In this approach, the practitioner learns by exploring 200+ hands-on,real-life scenarios. This unique style enables the practitioner to be more competent and highly productive from day 1. The program also includes 3 hours of dedicated LIVE doubt clearing sessions for every 6 hours of self pased workshop content to ensure your doubts are cleared and you are confident on the subject. In order to ensure high quality, we only intake a maximum of 20 students per LIVE doubt clearing session.</p>
