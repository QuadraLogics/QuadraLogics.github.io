Feature1H: "<span>What is</span> Use Case-based learning <span>?"

Feature1: Usecase-based learning approach engages learners in a hands-on exercise of specific scenarios that resemble real-world examples. This learner-centric method helps learners gain not only the required knowledge but the key skill to apply the gained knowledge. Focusing on learning how to apply knowledge is essential for practical subjects like DevOps. 
 
Feature2H: "<span>The Git and Github Actions for CI/CD </span>is a holistic program <span>that covers gitOps in detail</span>"

Feature2: Git is the most widely used and preferred distributed version control system. Git is used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. This is a keyboard driven workshop to enable participants to gain in depth practical knowledge.GitHub Actions are now the newest trend in the industry slowly replacing other CI/CD servers. It kind of automates your software workflow. We can now build , test and deploy code from the GitHub making our work easier and faster
